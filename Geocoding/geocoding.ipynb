        "The provided code outlines a process for extracting geographic details from location names in a dataset using geocoding services. Here's a breakdown of each part of the script:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Geolocator Initialization**:\n",
        "   - A geolocator instance is created using the `Nominatim` geocoding service from the `geopy` library. The `user_agent` parameter is set to \"geopy_app\" to identify the application making the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Function to Clean Location Names**:\n",
        "   - The `clean_location_name` function is designed to preprocess location names. It:\n",
        "     - Strips any leading or trailing whitespace.\n",
        "     - Removes non-alphabetical characters (except spaces and commas).\n",
        "     - Removes any occurrences of \"##\" and extra spaces, ensuring clean input for geocoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Function to Fetch Location Details**:\n",
        "   - The `get_location_details` function takes a location name and attempts to retrieve its geographic details (neighborhood, city, region, country).\n",
        "     - It first checks if the location name is not empty or just whitespace.\n",
        "     - It cleans the location name using the `clean_location_name` function.\n",
        "     - It uses the geolocator to fetch the geographic data with a timeout of 10 seconds.\n",
        "     - If successful, it extracts details like neighborhood, city, region, and country from the returned data.\n",
        "     - If an error occurs (e.g., due to an invalid location), the function prints the error and returns `None` for all details.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Batch Processing Function**:\n",
        "   - The `process_batch` function processes a batch of rows from the DataFrame (`df_batch`). For each row:\n",
        "     - It retrieves a list of locations extracted by spaCy (assumed to be stored in the column `spacy_extracted_locations`).\n",
        "     - It cleans each location name using the `clean_location_name` function and performs geocoding for each location.\n",
        "     - For each location, it appends the corresponding geographic details (neighborhood, city, region, country) to respective lists.\n",
        "     - It also tracks whether the geocoding was successful for all locations in the batch.\n",
        "     - A delay of 1 second (`time.sleep(1)`) is included between API calls to avoid overwhelming the geocoding service.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Test Sample and Processing**:\n",
        "   - A test sample of the DataFrame is loaded, with the first 6000 rows selected (`df.head(6000)`).\n",
        "   - The `process_batch` function is then called to process the sample and extract geographic details for each location.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Updating the DataFrame**:\n",
        "   - After processing, the results are used to populate new columns in the DataFrame:\n",
        "     - `neighbourhood`, `city`, `region`, `country`, and `geocoding_success` (indicating whether the geocoding was successful for the batch).\n",
        "   - The updated DataFrame is saved to a CSV file named `test_location_details.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the script prints a message indicating that the processing is complete and the results have been saved."
