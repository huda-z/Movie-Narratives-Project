# Movie-Narratives-Project

# Welcome!

Thank you for exploring my project! I hope you find the materials insightful as you dive into the work. Below is an overview of the key aspects of the project for better clarity and navigation.

## **Project Phases**
The project is divided into the following phases:
1. **Phase 1: Web Scraping for Data Collection**
2. **Phase 2: Data Preprocessing**
3. **Phase 3: Geocoding and Spatial Reference Extraction**
4. **Phase 4: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
5. **Phase 5: Temporal Analysis**

---

## **Code Organization**
The code is structured into folders corresponding to the project phases. Each folder contains the scripts and resources specific to that phase, ensuring the workflow remains clear and well-organized.

## **Instructions for the NLP Phase**
When working with the NLP phase, the following datasets are essential:  

- **Summary Country Analysis**:  
  Use the dataset `final_summary_cleaned_geocoded.csv`, located in the `summary` folder.  

- **Scripts Country/City Analysis**:  
  Use the dataset `12853_scripts_cleaned.csv`, located in the `scripts` folder.  

- **Summary City Analysis**:  
  Use the dataset `city_summary.csv`, located in the `summary` folder.

## **Visualizations**
The project provides interactive visualizations to showcase results:

### **Country-Level Visualizations**
Two HTML files are available for geographic visualizations at the country level for both datasets.  

### **City-Level Visualizations**
Three HTML files are provided for city-level visualizations:  
1. One for the summary dataset.  
2. Two for the scripts dataset, focusing on the top three cities mentioned.

> **Note**: The specifics of these visualizations may vary depending on the dataset type (summaries or scripts).
